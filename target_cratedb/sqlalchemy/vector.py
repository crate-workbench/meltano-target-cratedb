    """
    An improved implementation of the `FloatVector` data type for CrateDB,
    compared to the previous implementation on behalf of the LangChain adapter.

    https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/master/general/ddl/data-types.html#float-vector
    https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/master/general/builtins/scalar-functions.html#scalar-knn-match

    The previous implementation, based on SQLAlchemy's `UserDefinedType`, didn't
    respect the `python_type` property on backward/reverse resolution of types.
    This was observed on Meltano's database connector machinery doing a
    type cast, which led to a `NotImplementedError`.

        typing.cast(type, sql_type.python_type) => NotImplementedError

    The `UserDefinedType` approach is easier to implement, because it doesn't
    need compiler support.

    To get full SQLAlchemy type support, including support for forward- and
    backward resolution / type casting, the custom data type should derive
    from SQLAlchemy's `TypeEngine` base class instead.

    When deriving from `TypeEngine`, you will need to set the `__visit_name__`
    attribute, and add a corresponding visitor method to the `CrateTypeCompiler`,
    in this case, `visit_FLOAT_VECTOR`.

    Now, rendering a DDL succeeds. However, when reflecting the DDL schema back,
    it doesn't work until you will establish a corresponding reverse type mapping.

    By invoking `SELECT DISTINCT(data_type) FROM information_schema.columns;`,
    you will find out that the internal type name is `float_vector`, so you
    announce it to the dialect using `TYPES_MAP["float_vector"] = FloatVector`.

    Still not there: `NotImplementedError: Default TypeEngine.as_generic() heuristic
    method was unsuccessful for target_cratedb.sqlalchemy.vector.FloatVector. A
    custom as_generic() method must be implemented for this type class.`

    So, as it signals that the type implementation also needs an `as_generic`
    property, let's supply one, returning `sqltypes.ARRAY`.

    It looks like, in exchange to those improvements, the `get_col_spec`
    method is not needed any longer.

    TODO: Would it be a good idea to derive from SQLAlchemy's
          `ARRAY` right away, to get a few of the features without
          the need to redefine them?

    Please note the outcome of this analysis and the corresponding implementation
    has been derived from empirical observations, and from the feeling that we also
    lack corresponding support on the other special data types of CrateDB (ARRAY and
    OBJECT) within the SQLAlchemy dialect, i.e. "that something must be wrong or
    incomplete". In this spirit, it is advisable to review and improve their
    implementations correspondingly.
